    age bar chart + gender pie chart + heat chart  - LP

2) Does race play a role? Bar chart or  hatch-filled histogram - HP

3) Does lifestyle (smoking/drinking) play a factor? Heat chart - SG

4) Does general/mental/physical health and status play a role? - HS

5) Does sleep time play a role? Discrete distribution chart - HP

6) Does any co-morbidity (asthma, kidney disease, skin cancer, and diabities) play a role? Anotated heat maps -JS
