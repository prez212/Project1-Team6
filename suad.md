# Analysis
My part of the Project1 Role was to find out if unhealthy lifetyles play a factor in heart disease :
what role do Smoking, and Dringking alcohol play in heart disease?


The data was located in Resources folder heart_2020_cleaned.csv


1. as the data was already cleaned, I used the following columns to analyze Smoking and Alcohol drinking 
•	HeartDisease
•	Smoking
•	Dringking alcohol

# Smoking and Heart Disease

2. Calculated The total smoker with heart disease
•	Smoking vs HeartDisease
•	Dringking alcohol


3. The result was showing bias because the majority of the population didn't suffer heart disease in the overall sample.  
	


4. Plotted a pie chart for Smokers who had heart disease, Smokers who had no heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease

# Alcohol Drinking and Heart Disease

5. The result was showing bias because alcohol consumption population was under represented in the overall sample.  
	Thus, calculated total number of Alcohol Drinking and non Alcohol Drinking



6. Plotted a pie chart for Alcohol drinkers who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had no heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease

# Conclusion 
Smoking Alcohol Drinking contribute immensely to heart disease, from the data, smokers and alcohol drinkers who had heart disease were double that of smokers and alcohol drinkers who didn't smoke and didn't drink but had heart disease.

It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to decrease the chances of suffering from heart disease. It is equally as important for people with heart disease reduce their smoking and drinking.
