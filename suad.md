My part of the Project1 Role was to find out the unhealthy lifetyles on heart disease prediction:
what role do Smoking, and Dringking alcohol play in heart disease?

The data was located in Resources folder heart_2020_cleaned.csv

1, as the data was already cleaned, just planed to use the following columns
•	HeartDisease
•	Smoking
•	Dringking alcohol


2. Calculated 
•	Smoking vs HeartDisease
•	Dringking alcohol

Smoking vs Heart Disease
3. The result was showing bias because some of the population were under represented in the overall sample.  the data was not collected equally 
	Thus, calculated total number of smokers and non smokers 


4. Plotted a pie chart for Smokers who had heart disease, Smokers who had no heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease

Alcohol Drinking vs Heart Disease
5. The result was showing bias because some of the population were under represented in the overall sample.  the data was not collected equally 
	Thus, calculated total number of Alcohol Drinking and non Alcohol Drinking


6, Plotted a pie chart for Alcohol drinkers who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had no heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease

Conclusion 
Smoking: smoking contributes to heart disease, from the data, smokers who had heart disease were outnumbered non smokers who had heart disease. 
Alcohol Drinking
It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to decrease the chances of suffering from heart disease. It is also important for people with heart disease reduce their smoking and drinking
