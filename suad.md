1, as the data was already cleaned, I selected the following to answer the above question

Smoking and Heart Disease
3. The result was showing bias because a large percentage of the population (58.7 %) Do not smoke.

4. Plotted a pie chart for Smokers who had heart disease, Smokers who had no heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease, non smokers who had heart disease

5. The visualization helped me the distribution of individuals in different groups and provides the relationship between smoking and heart disease

Alcohol Drinking vs Heart Disease

5. The result was showing bias because some of the population were under represented in the overall sample.  the data was not collected equally 
	Thus, calculated total number of Alcohol Drinking and non Alcohol Drinking

6. Plotted a pie chart for Alcohol drinkers who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had no heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease, Alcohol drinkers  who had heart disease

Conclusion 
Smoking: smoking and Alcohol Drinking contribute to heart disease, from the data, the majority are non smokers out of which a small portion have heart disease. Smokers were at higher risk of heart . 
Alcohol Drinking: The majority are alcohol drinkers out of which a small portion have a heart disease. Alcohol drinkers are at a higher risk of developing heart disease. 
It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to decrease the chances of suffering from heart disease. It is also important for people with heart disease reduce their smoking and drinking
